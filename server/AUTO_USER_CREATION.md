# Automatic User Creation System

## Overview
The system now automatically creates Firestore user documents when new users log in via Firebase Auth. This eliminates the need for manual user synchronization.

## How It Works

### 1. **Login Detection**
- When a user logs in, the `autoCreateUser` middleware checks if they exist in Firestore
- If not found, it automatically creates a user document

### 2. **User Document Creation**
For new users, the system creates:
```javascript
{
  email: "user@example.com",
  displayName: "User Name",
  name: "User Name", 
  status: "active",
  role: "Member",
  createdAt: new Date(),
  lastLoginAt: new Date(),
  photoURL: "generated avatar URL",
  uid: "firebase-auth-uid",
  autoCreated: true,
  firstLogin: new Date()
}
```

### 3. **Welcome Notification**
- New users automatically receive a welcome notification
- Notification appears in the bell icon in the top bar

### 4. **Team Integration**
- New users are automatically available in the team members list
- They can immediately be assigned to projects and receive invitations

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
Add to your `.env` file:
```bash
# Auto-add new users to team (optional)
AUTO_ADD_NEW_USERS_TO_TEAM=true
```

### Features
- ✅ **Automatic user document creation**
- ✅ **Welcome notifications**
- ✅ **Team integration**
- ✅ **Last login tracking**
- ✅ **Avatar generation**

## Testing the Feature

### 1. **Test New User Login**
1. Create a new Firebase Auth account (different email)
2. Log in to the application
3. Check server logs for auto-creation messages:
   ```
   🆕 New user detected: newuser@example.com
   📝 Creating Firestore user document...
   ✅ Auto-created user document for: newuser@example.com
   📧 Welcome notification created for: newuser@example.com
   ```

### 2. **Verify Team Integration**
1. Go to Team page
2. New user should appear in the list
3. They can receive invitations immediately

### 3. **Check Welcome Notification**
1. New user should see notification bell with (1) indicator
2. Click bell to see welcome message

## Benefits

1. **No Manual Sync Required** - Users appear immediately after login
2. **Seamless Experience** - New users get instant access to team features  
3. **Welcome Flow** - New users receive helpful notifications
4. **Automatic Team Addition** - No additional steps needed for team access
5. **Data Consistency** - Firebase Auth and Firestore stay in sync

## Server Logs
The system provides detailed logging:
- `🆕 New user detected: email (uid)`
- `📝 Creating Firestore user document...`
- `✅ Auto-created user document for: email`
- `📧 Welcome notification created for: email`
- `👥 Auto-adding email to team...`

## Error Handling
- Failed user creation doesn't break the login flow
- Notification failures are logged but don't affect user creation
- All errors are gracefully handled with appropriate logging
